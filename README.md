# lambda-rs

A type checker and interpreter for simply typed lambda calculus extended with records, variants and recursion written in Rust.

# Building

This interpreter is written in Rust on the stable toolchain, visit https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html for instructions on how to install Rust. Afterwards the project can be built using `cargo build` and can be run with `cargo run <file>`, `<file>` being a path to a file with lambda code.
